# Robo Stock Portfolio Advisor

## Project Overview
This project involves the development of a Python program that consumes a list of stocks and generates the safest possible portfolio from the given stocks. The core objective is to design and implement an algorithm that evaluates the correlation between different stocks' historical data and selects the least correlated group of stocks to maximize portfolio diversification and minimize risk.

## Key Features
- Stock List Consumption: The program accepts a list of stocks as input.
- Historical Data Analysis: It retrieves and analyzes historical data from Yahoo Finance for each stock in the list.
- Correlation Comparison: An algorithm compares the correlation between the historical data of different stocks.
- Optimal Portfolio Selection: The program selects the least correlated group of stocks to form a diversified and low-risk portfolio.
